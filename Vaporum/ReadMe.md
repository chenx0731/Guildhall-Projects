Deep learning

When I started the Starship Gold assignment, I realize that it's really different from the former assignments. Sometimes people love freedom, but sometimes people love limits.

I easily get overwhelmed by brainstorm thoughts, and just stop working for some weird satisfactions and fears for realizing them. I think that is because I can't accept the imperfect features.

So in some ways I like the limits to specific everything I need to do. But that won't take me on the right way for self development. For this unlimited assignment, I thought I need to find some way out. The first thing I did is just doing something, even a very little progress. Building all the basic functions can make me settle down from panic. And then I can iterate the basic features to higher levels later on. Secondly, I started to try accepting imperfect me. Even the codes, the functions suck at the first beginning, I shouldn't just give them up so easily. And the last thing, choose my own battles. During the development of A4, I witnessed so many wonderful features completed by brilliant classmates. I was amazed and also felt left behind. But I realized that I need to focus on my own path. My development, pace and schedule should be 99% driven by myself. 

So in later project, I think I would keep these solutions to level up myself. To make vague things clear, make bad things better, and make my motivations purer.
